        <li>4 Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>1 Cup Ranch Dressing</li>
        <li>1 Cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li>1 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Tablespoon Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Bacon Crunbles</li>
    </ul>
    <!--How to make the dish-->
    <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 375°F and spray an 8 x 11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>If the breasts are uneven in thickness, pound them to an even 1” thickness using a meat pounder.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of meat with half the grated Parmesan cheese, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together Ranch dressing and sour cream. Pour the mixture over the chicken breasts and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375°F for 20-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast reads 150°F.</li>
        <li>Set oven to broil and broil the breast an additional 2-4 minutes or until the chicken turns golden. It will burn quickly so watch closely.</li>
        <li>The chicken is cooked through when the thermometer reads 160°F when inserted in the thickest part of the middle breast.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with cooked bacon crumbles. Allow the chicken to rest a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish with diced parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
