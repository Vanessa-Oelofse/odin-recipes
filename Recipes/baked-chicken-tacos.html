            <!--How to make the dish-->
            <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Spray a 9Ã—13 baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet.</li>
        <li>Add onion to skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chicken, taco seasoning, tomatoes (FULLY DRAINED), and green chiles (FULLY DRAINED) *see note.
            Stir to combine fully. Reduce to simmer and allow to cook for 5-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the taco shells in the baking dish, standing up. I was able to fit 10 taco shells in the dish by
            adding 2 on each side.</li>
        <li>Bake the taco shells for 5 minutes by themselves to allow them to crisp up. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 tablespoon of beans into the bottom of each taco shell. Top with the chicken mixture, almost to the
            top of each shell.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each shell generously with shredded cheese, the more the better!</li>
        <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes or until cheese is fully melted and the edges of the shells are browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and top with your favorite items such as jalapenos, sour cream, cilantro, and salsa.</li>
            </ol>
